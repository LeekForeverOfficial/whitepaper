## 1. Core Philosophy and Ideological Foundation

### 1.1 Redefining the Cultural Symbol

"Leek" is no longer a passive victim of financial markets, but rather:

- **A Symbol of Resilience**: Life force that continues to grow amid market volatility
- **Representative of Community Symbiosis**: Unity of individual and collective interests
- **Pioneer of Value Creation**: Transformation from consumer to owner

### 1.2 Project Vision

To build a self-evolving, benefit-sharing, and value-sustaining decentralized digital nation where:

- Early contributors receive continuous returns matching their contributions
- External investors and core communities form beneficial alliances rather than competitive relationships
- Value creation and distribution form a perfect closed loop

### 1.3 Core Innovation Highlights

1. **Eternal Liquidity Pool** - The unshakeable foundation of trust
2. **Dynamic Release Economics** - "Passing the Torch" growth engine
3. **Multi-layer Rights System** - Clear interest stratification and synergy
4. **Cash Flow Rights** - From speculative assets to productive capital
5. **Ecological Symbiosis Design** - Project value amplification as an incubation platform

## 2. Tokenomics 4.0

### 2.1 "Foundation Building" Model Core

LeekForever is co-founded by 33,333 genesis members. Each member's 50U investment constructs the entire ecosystem from three dimensions:

These 33,333 people are not merely early participants, but co-founders and permanent foundations of this digital nation.

- First 33,333 users complete permanent lock-up
- Establish approximately 1,000,000 USD in base liquidity
- Each participant receives genesis SBT identity credential

#### 3.1.2 Ascension Phase (≥33,334 people)

**Dynamic Release Trigger Conditions**:

- System activates when total lock-up users reaches 33,333

└── Activity: Governance participation + holdings + community contribution
```

**Release Process**:

1. New user N completes lock-up, injects 50U liquidity
2. System opens one round of "Ascension Bidding"
3. Existing lock-up users consume contribution scores to participate
4. System selects user with highest [contribution score × consumption ratio]
5. Selected user receives 50U liquidity release, bonus rewards, SBT marked "Ascended"
